    <h3>Act-2 , scene The Picture Gallery in Ruddigore Castle</h3>
    
    <p>Picture Gallery in Ruddigore Castle.  The walls are
       covered with full-length portraits of the Baronets of
       Ruddigore from the time of James I.—the first being that of
       Sir Rupert, alluded to in the legend; the last, that of the
       last deceased Baronet, Sir Roderic.

  Enter Robin and Adam melodramatically.  They are greatly altered
       in appearance, Robin wearing the haggard aspect of a guilty
       roue; Adam, that of the wicked steward to such a man.

                         DUET—ROBIN and ADAM.

  ROB.           I once was as meek as a new-born lamb,
                      I'm now Sir Murgatroyd—ha! ha!
                           With greater precision
                           (Without the elision),
                      Sir Ruthven Murgatroyd—ha! ha!

  ADAM.          And I, who was once his valley-de-sham,
                      As steward I'm now employed—ha! ha!
                           The dickens may take him—
                           I'll never forsake him!
                      As steward I'm now employed—ha! ha!

                            ADDITIONAL SONG
                     (Omitted after opening night.)

  ROB.      My face is the index to my mind,
            All venom and spleen and gall—ha! ha!
            Or, properly speaking,
            It soon will be reeking,
            With venom and spleen and gall—ha! ha!

  ADAM.     My name from Adam Goodheart you'll find
            I've changed to Gideon Crawle—ha! ha!
            For bad Bart's steward
            Whose heart is much too hard
            Is always Gideon Crawle—ha! ha!

  BOTH.     How dreadful when an innocent heart
            Becomes, perforce, a bad young Bart.,
            And still more hard on old Adam,
            His former faithful valley-de-sham!

  ROB.      This is a painful state of things, old Adam!

       ADAM.  Painful, indeed!  Ah, my poor master, when I swore
  that, come what would, I would serve you in all things for ever,
  I little thought to what a pass it would bring me!  The
  confidential adviser to the greatest villain unhung!  Now, sir,
  to business.  What crime do you propose to commit to-day?
       ROB.  How should I know?  As my confidential adviser, it's
  your duty to suggest something.
       ADAM.  Sir, I loathe the life you are leading, but a good
  old man's oath is paramount, and I obey.  Richard Dauntless is
  here with pretty Rose Maybud, to ask your consent to their
  marriage.  Poison their beer.
       ROB.  No—not that—I know I'm a bad Bart., but I'm not as
  bad a Bart. as all that.
       ADAM.  Well, there you are, you see!  It's no use my making
  suggestions if you don't adopt them.
       ROB.  (melodramatically).  How would it be, do you think,
  were I to lure him here with cunning wile—bind him with good
  stout rope to yonder post—and then, by making hideous faces at
  him, curdle the heart-blood in his arteries, and freeze the very
  marrow in his bones?  How say you, Adam, is not the scheme well
  planned?
       ADAM.  It would be simply rude—nothing more.  But
  soft—they come!

  (Adam and Robin retire up as Richard and Rose enter, preceded by
       Chorus of Bridesmaids.)

                        DUET—RICHARD and ROSE.

  RICH.          Happily coupled are we,
                                You see—
                 I am a jolly Jack Tar,
                                My star,
                      And you are the fairest,
                      The richest and rarest
                 Of innocent lasses you are,
                                By far—
                 Of innocent lasses you are!
                 Fanned by a favouring gale,
                                You'll sail
                 Over life's treacherous sea
                                With me,
                      And as for bad weather,
                      We'll brave it together,
                 And you shall creep under my lee,
                                My wee!
                 And you shall creep under my lee!
                 For you are such a smart little craft—
                 Such a neat little, sweet little craft,
                      Such a bright little, tight little,
                      Slight little, light little,
                 Trim little, prim little craft!

  CHORUS.        For she is such, etc.

  ROSE.          My hopes will be blighted, I fear,
                                My dear;
                 In a month you'll be going to sea,
                                Quite free,
                      And all of my wishes
                      You'll throw to the fishes
                 As though they were never to be;
                                Poor me!
                 As though they were never to be.
                 And I shall be left all alone
                                To moan,
                 And weep at your cruel deceit,
                                Complete;
                      While you'll be asserting
                      Your freedom by flirting
                 With every woman you meet,
                                You cheat—Ah!
                 With every woman you meet! Ah!

                 Though I am such a smart little craft—
                 Such a neat little, sweet little craft,
                      Such a bright little, tight little,
                      Slight little, light little,
                 Trim little, prim little craft!

  CHORUS.        Though she is such, etc.

                             (Enter Robin.)

       ROB.  Soho! pretty one—in my power at last, eh?  Know ye
  not that I have those within my call who, at my lightest bidding,
  would immure ye in an uncomfortable dungeon?  (Calling.)  What
  ho! within there!
       RICH.  Hold—we are prepared for this (producing a Union
  Jack).  Here is a flag that none dare defy (all kneel), and while
  this glorious rag floats over Rose Maybud's head, the man does
  not live who would dare to lay unlicensed hand upon her!
       ROB.  Foiled—and by a Union Jack!  But a time will come,
  and then—-
       ROSE.  Nay, let me plead with him.  (To Robin.)  Sir Ruthven,
  have pity.  In my book of etiquette the case of a maiden about to
  be wedded to one who unexpectedly turns out to be a baronet with
  a curse on him is not considered.  Time was when you loved me
  madly.  Prove that this was no selfish love by according your
  consent to my marriage with one who, if he be not you yourself,
  is the next best thing—your dearest friend!

                            BALLAD—ROSE.

                 In bygone days I had thy love—
                      Thou hadst my heart.
                 But Fate, all human vows above,
                      Our lives did part!
                 By the old love thou hadst for me—
                 By the fond heart that beat for thee—
                 By joys that never now can be,
                      Grant thou my prayer!

  ALL (kneeling).          Grant thou her prayer!

  ROB.  (recitative).      Take her—I yield!

  ALL. (recitative).            Oh, rapture!  (All rising.)

  CHORUS.        Away to the parson we go—
                      Say we're solicitous very
                 That he will turn two into one—
                      Singing hey, derry down derry!

  RICH.          For she is such a smart little craft-
  ROSE.          Such a neat little, sweet little craft—
  RICH.               Such a bright little-
  ROSE.                    Tight little-
  RICH.                    Slight little-
  ROSE.                    Light little-
  BOTH.               Trim little, prim little craft!
