    ROB AND ADAM
 <h5 class="rob"> ROB. </h><p class="speech"> I once was as meek as a new-born lamb,
  I'm now Sir Murgatroyd—ha! ha!
       With greater precision
       (Without the elision),
  Sir Ruthven Murgatroyd—ha! ha!</p>

<h5 class ="adam">ADAM.</h5> <p class="speech"> And I, who was once his valley-de-sham,
  As steward I'm now employed—ha! ha!
       The dickens may take him—
       I'll never forsake him!
  As steward I'm now employed—ha! ha!

        ADDITIONAL SONG
 (Omitted after opening night.)</p>

<h5 class ="rob"> ROB.  </h5><p class="speech"> My face is the index to my mind,
All venom and spleen and gall—ha! ha!
Or, properly speaking,
It soon will be reeking,
With venom and spleen and gall—ha! ha!</p>

<h5 class ="adam">ADAM. </h5><p class="speech"> My name from Adam Goodheart you'll find
I've changed to Gideon Crawle—ha! ha!
For bad Bart's steward
Whose heart is much too hard
Is always Gideon Crawle—ha! ha!</p>

BOTH.     How dreadful when an innocent heart
Becomes, perforce, a bad young Bart.,
And still more hard on old Adam,
His former faithful valley-de-sham!

<h5 class="rob">ROB.</h5><p class="speech">This is a painful state of things, old Adam!</p>
